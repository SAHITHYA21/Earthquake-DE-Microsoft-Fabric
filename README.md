# 🌍 Earthquake Data Engineering Project with Microsoft Fabric

## 📌 Project Overview
This project demonstrates the development of an **end-to-end data engineering and analytics pipeline** for processing **global earthquake events**.  
Leveraging **Microsoft Fabric’s Data Factory, Data Engineering, and Power BI** capabilities, the solution automates the ingestion, cleaning, transformation, and visualization of real-time earthquake data from the **United States Geological Survey (USGS) API**.

The pipeline follows a **multi-layer architecture**:
- **Bronze Layer** → Raw data ingestion
- **Silver Layer** → Data cleaning and standardization
- **Gold Layer** → Business-ready datasets optimized for analytics

This architecture ensures **data accuracy, scalability, and performance optimization**, enabling analysts and stakeholders to extract valuable insights quickly.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- **Programming:** Python, PySpark  
- **Data Platform:** Microsoft Fabric (Data Factory, Data Engineering)  
- **Visualization:** Power BI  
- **Data Source:** USGS Earthquake Events API

## 📂 Repository Contents

### 1️⃣ Bronze Layer – Raw Data Ingestion
- Connects to the **USGS API** to fetch worldwide earthquake events.  
- Stores the data in its raw form to maintain data integrity.  
- Performs minimal preprocessing (e.g., schema definition, timestamp parsing).  

**Key Goal:** Preserve original data for historical tracking and reproducibility.

---

### 2️⃣ Silver Layer – Data Cleaning & Transformation
- Handles missing values, type casting, and field normalization.  
- Converts raw JSON into structured tables for easy querying.  
- Integrates geospatial attributes for mapping capabilities in Power BI.  

**Key Goal:** Provide a standardized, high-quality dataset for analytics.

---

### 3️⃣ Gold Layer – Analytics-Ready Datasets
- Aggregates and enriches data for analytical use cases.  
- Optimizes storage formats (e.g., Delta/Parquet) for fast querying.  
- Prepares datasets for specific reporting purposes such as **trend analysis, magnitude distribution, and regional impact studies**.  

**Key Goal:** Deliver business-ready datasets for decision-making and reporting.

---

## 📊 Power BI Dashboard
The final **Gold Layer datasets** are connected to Power BI to create interactive dashboards that allow users to:
- Visualize global earthquake activity in real time.
- Filter events by magnitude, region, or time period.
- Analyze historical seismic trends to identify high-risk zones.
- Display earthquake significance and depth on interactive maps.
